CET 3640 - Software for Computer control

Programming concepts and software development techniques for computer controlled systems.
Laboratory exercises apply these concepts to a variety of systems and devices.

This repository reflects all the labaratory exercises i programmed for this course. 
It's usually taught either in C++ or Java, since it's an object-oriented programming class.
The Professor for this cource decided to use Java for this class as Java has no room for sequential programming as C++ does.
